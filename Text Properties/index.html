    <h1>Red Panda</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The red panda <a href="righthere">(Ailurus fulgens)</a> is a mammal species native to the eastern
      Himalayas and southwestern China. It is listed as Endangered on the IUCN
      Red List because the wild population is estimated at fewer than 10,000
      mature individuals and continues to decline due to habitat loss and
      fragmentation, poaching, and inbreeding depression.[1] Despite its name,
      it is not closely related to the giant panda.[3]
    </p>
    <p>
      The red panda has reddish-brown fur, a long, shaggy tail, and a waddling
      gait due to its shorter front legs; it is roughly the size of a domestic
      cat, though with a longer body. It is arboreal and feeds mainly on bamboo,
      but also eats eggs, birds, and insects. It is a solitary animal, mainly
      active from dusk to dawn, and is largely sedentary during the day. It is
      also called the lesser panda, the red bear-cat, and the red cat-bear.[4]

    <h2>Conservation</h2>
    <p>
      The red panda is listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List since 2008
      because the global population is estimated at about 10,000 individuals,
      with a decreasing population trend; only about half of the total area of
      potential habitat of 142,000 km2 (55,000 sq mi) is actually being used by
      the species. Due to its shy and secretive nature, and its largely
      nocturnal habits, observation of red pandas is difficult. Therefore,
      population figures in the wild are determined by population density
      estimates and not direct counts. It is protected in all range countries,
      and hunting is illegal. It is listed in CITES Appendix I.[1]

    <h2>Taxonomy</h2>
    <p>
      Ailurus fulgens was the scientific name proposed by Frédéric Cuvier in
      1825, who described a zoological specimen sent by Alfred Duvaucel "from
      the mountains north of India". He was the first to also use the vernacular
      name panda.[40][41]

    <h3>Evolutionary History</h3>
    <p>
      The red panda is considered a living fossil and only distantly related to
      the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), as it is naturally more closely
      related to the other members of the superfamily Musteloidea to which it
      belongs. The common ancestor of both pandas can be traced back to the
      Paleogene period tens of millions of years ago, with a wide distribution
      across Eurasia.
